            I worked in the Digital Marketing domain as an Account Specialist in
            the Ad Success Team at Amazon India. I worked alongside an Account
            executive to provide customized recommendations and build campaigns
            for the sellers and vendors on Amazon. I was also a quality Analyst,
            where I reviewed recommendation reports sent by specialists to
            clients. I was also responsible for curating and analyzing Voice of
            Customer data for the Japanese marketplace. I designed and
            implemented a streamlined process that helped reduce the response
            time for a customer's query. I was also part of the Event control
            rooms for Prime Day and Black Friday Cyber Monday sales, where I
            provided real-time bid recommendations to the clients to increase
            their sales during the peak hours of the event.

            My primary responsibilities in the project were to develop and
            unit-test components in Core-java for a Japanese Client called JA
            Kyousai and for the project called Zenkyouren. This project was
            re-building an application developed in COBOL with Java with
            additional enhanced features. Along with that, I also worked
            independently on IT bug fixes at the Integration stage of the
            project. My other responsibilities included writing Specification
            documents in Japanese from the client's business requirement
            documents, reviewing components developed by the team members before
            sending them over to the Japan team, and Analyzing the team's
            quality based on the review comments(Shiteki) received by developers
            and coming up with a plan or a checklist to improve the quality of
            the team.
